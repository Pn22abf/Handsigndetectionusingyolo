This repository contains code for teaching and assessing a YOLO-based object identification model with SuperGradients. To get started, run 'pip install super-gradients==3.4.0 imutils roboflow is pytube --upgrade'. Divide your dataset into folders for testing, validation, and training photos and labels, then adjust the 'dataset_params' in the source code accordingly. The code contains routines for loading YOLO-formatted data and configuring data loaders. Just set up your dataset, change the directions in the program, and execute it to begin preprocessing. Contributions are accepted through pull requests.
